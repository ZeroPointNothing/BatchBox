# BatchBox
Contains several Batch programs I've worked on.

Will eventually be packaged all together and become the Official place for things such as the BatchQuest downloader.

# ! NOTE !

Windows Smart Screen will warn you about each and every one of these Batch programs. This is normal, and is because I don't bother adding signatures to all of them. You can easily confirm that none of these files are malacious in any way just be looking at their code here.

To ignore this, click "more info" and "Run Anyway"
